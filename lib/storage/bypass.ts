/**
 * Session-scoped bypass for the trial interceptor.
 *
 * When the user clicks "I disagree — proceed anyway" on the verdict
 * screen, we add the current site to this set. For the rest of the
 * browser session, every checkout click on that site is allowed to
 * pass through to /checkout without triggering a new trial. The user
 * gets exactly one bypass per override, but the bypass lasts for the
 * rest of the session (not just the next click) so they can browse,
 * come back, and click checkout again without seeing the trial.
 *
 * Storage: `chrome.storage.session` is per-tab-session, NOT synced,
 * and cleared when the browser closes. This is exactly the scope
 * we want — the bypass survives navigation, page reloads, and tab
 * refocuses, but doesn't persist across browser restarts (the user
 * has to actively opt in via the override button each session).
 *
 * Reads use an in-memory cache so the synchronous click handler
 * can ask "is this site bypassed right now?" without awaiting an
 * async storage call. The cache is refreshed on startup, on every
 * override, and after the storage is mutated.
